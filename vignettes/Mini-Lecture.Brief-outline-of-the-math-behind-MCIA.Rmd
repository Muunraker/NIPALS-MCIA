# Introduction
Multiple Co-Inertia Analysis (MCIA) is a joint dimensionality  reduction method which takes as input multiple datasets from the same sample but different different experimental sources. This method then calculates factors that find relationships across all data sources and the resulting matrix compositions can be used for a variety of downstream analyses.
