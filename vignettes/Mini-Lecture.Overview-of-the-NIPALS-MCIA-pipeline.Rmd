# Introduction
The Mini-Lecture, Brief outline of the math behind MCIA, covered the mathematical aspects of MCIA, this second Mini-Lecture will focus on the standard preprocessing of multi-block data and post-processing following MCIA. The target audience of this Mini-Lecture are bioinformaticians as well as other practitioners in data science.
