# Introduction
The Mini-Lecture, Brief outline of the math behind MCIA, covered the mathematical aspects of MCIA.  
This second Mini-Lecture will cover the full MCIA pipeline, with a focus on the standard preprocessing of multi-block data and post-processing following MCIA.  
The target audience of this Mini-Lecture are bioinformaticians or any other general practitioners.
